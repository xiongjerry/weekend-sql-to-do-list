# Project Name

To Do List CRUD APP

## Description

In this project, I've used JQuery and SQL to setup a website that makes a to do list.
Problems I've encountered was how to make a meaningful PUT route that updates the DOM.
At first I wanted to make a boolean that shows up on the DOM but thought that the idea
of having true and false appear in the app was too generic, so I decided to make it a
VARCHAR that defaulted to 'Not yet'. Then if clicked it would change to 'Yup'. This was
one of the main problems I face while creating this website from scratch.
